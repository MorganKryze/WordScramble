## Principle:


The principle of the game is to locate, in a grid filled with **letters**, words known from the dictionary, read in **both directions**, horizontally, vertically and diagonally. 

Unlike **crosswords**, the absence of black boxes offers players **many complexities** and intersections.


## Game unfolding:


The player can first choose to create a **new game**, or to resume **one in progress**.

- In the **first case**, the player will be asked to *name the game*, the *first player* and finally the *second player*. 

- In the **second case**, the game will resume with its *former attributes*. 

The game is based on **turn-by-turn**. Players compete on grids of five different **difficulty levels**. The size of the grid increases, as does the number of words and directions. The game ends after both players have played on the **fifth round grid**.

The winner is defined by the **score** obtained by each player.

The game is playable with an **English** and **French** dictionary available in the options menu.
